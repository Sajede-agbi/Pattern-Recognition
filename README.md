# Pattern-Recognition
This project aims to distinguish between healthy individuals and stroke patients using health-related data. The dataset is publicly available here:
https://www.kaggle.com/fedesoriano/stroke-prediction-dataset

The workflow includes:

* Data preprocessing and handling missing values
* Visualization of key health indicators
* Classification using six different models:

. Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
2. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
3. Support Vector Machine (SVM)
4. Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)
5. Naive Bayes
6. Decision Tree

The goal is to evaluate and compare these classifiers in terms of accuracy and performance on the stroke prediction task.
